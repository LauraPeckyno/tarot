    <p>For hundreds of years, people have turned to the wisdom of the tarot for insight, guidance, and divination. This powerful practice may seem mystical or hard to understand, but it’s completely accessible to you with a bit of time and practice! Reading tarot cards takes a combination of knowledge and intuition that anyone can develop. If you want to get started on your tarot journey, you’ve come to the right place.</p>
    <h2>Things You Should Know</h2>
    <ul className="boxedul">
      <li>Start by getting familiar with the tarot deck and the individual meanings of each of the cards. This may take some time, so be patient with yourself!</li>
<li>Pick a tarot spread for your reading. You could try a simple Yes/No reading or a 3-card Past/Present/Future spread.</li>
<li>When choosing an inquiry for your reading, pick an open-ended question. This allows the tarot to provide in-depth, complex insights to the situation.</li>
<li>Remember that cards can be dealt reversed (upside down). This changes their meaning! When you are dealt a reversed card, both meanings will be displayed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Learn about how the tarot deck works</h3>
<p>The 78 cards of the tarot deck are split into two groups: the major arcana and the minor arcana. The first 22 cards of the deck make up the major arcana, and they represent major life events. The remaining 55 cards make up the minor arcana, and they deal with more day-to-day matters</p>
    <h2>Use a Guidebook</h2>
    <p>Guidebooks can help you understand the basics of tarot so that you can get started with your readings. You can also learn about other card layouts that may be a little more advanced.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43548" target="_blank">The Illustrated Key to the Tarot</a> by LW De Laurence is a classic guidebook that is available for free online. You can find it in various formats at Project Gutenberg. </p>
