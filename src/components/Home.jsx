    <div className="left"><p>Tarot card reading is a form of cartomancy allowing practitioners to use tarot cards to gain insight into the past, present or future. When using the cards, you formulate a question, then draw cards to interpret your query.</p>
    <p>We're using the Rider–Waite–Smith deck, which was released in 1909. It was the first complete cartomantic tarot deck. The deck, designed by Arthur Edward Waite, was illustrated by Pamela Colman Smith.</p>
    <p>We invite you to embrace your inner mystic and use these tarot cards to help you understand your past, center your present, and envision your future.</p>
